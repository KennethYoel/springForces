# Spring Forces
Boing! Time to simulate a spring force! This challenge from [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/160-spring-forces.html) fits into chapter 2 and 3 of the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com) and demonstrates how to simulate the oscillating motion of a spring using vectors and forces[^1].
